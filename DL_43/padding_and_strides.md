# In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), stride and padding are techniques that can be used to adjust the dimensionality of data.

## Stride is a parameter that works in conjunction with padding. Padding is the feature that puts empty blanks into the frame of the image to minimize the reduction of size in the output layer. Actually, it is a way of increasing the size of an image to balance the size reduced by the strides.
