A pre-trained model is a model created and trained by someone else to solve a problem that is similar to ours. In practice, someone is almost always a tech giant or a group of star researchers. They usually choose a very large dataset as their base datasets such as ImageNet or the Wikipedia Corpus. Then, they create a large neural network (e.g., VGG19 has 143,667,240 parameters) to solve a particular problem (e.g., this problem is image classification for VGG19). Of course, this pre-trained model must be made public so that we can take these models and repurpose them.
